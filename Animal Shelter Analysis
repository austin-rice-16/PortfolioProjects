--Only around 2-3 percent of animals at this shelter get euthanized. 
--What kinds of animals should be pushed harder for adoption?

--Based off this, the shelter should provide more resources on getting domestic shorthair cats and pit bull dogs adopted. 
--Additionally, the younger animals seem to be more likely to be put down.
